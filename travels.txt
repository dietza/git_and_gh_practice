Just before beginning Turing, I went on an incredible backpacking trip with my friend, Mike.
The trail is an unofficial loop which begins on one side of Ouray, CO and comes around to end on the other side of town.
We covered about 25mi over two nights and three days, living out of our backpacks.
We didn't realize exactly what we were getting into, and it was so rewarding.
On the second day, we did Engineer Pass, the 13er summit of Darley Mt., and 2 more mountain passes before settling on a campsite around 6pm.
That night, we each enjoyed the most satisfying beer ever after each carrying an extra 12oz all that way, chilling the cans in the snowmelt of the creek below,
and witnessing the most unbelievable backcountry sunset over 'the Switzerland of the Americas'.
